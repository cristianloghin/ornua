<p>Against a backdrop of lower dairy prices, it is now more important than ever that we ensure that Irish dairy continues to be marketed as a premium product and that IDB continues to add value through brands and innovation.</p>
<p>The marketing strategy of the Consumer Foods division is centred on leveraging the unique provenance and quality of Irish milk from grass-fed cows. The story of Kerrygold begins with traditional family farms and a sustainable, low-carbon grass-based dairy system, which is unrivalled anywhere in the world. Marketing activity strives to bring the consumer closer to these farmers.</p>
<p>Continued investments in branding and NPD have strengthened the position and offering of Kerrygold and other brands such as Pilgrims Choice and Kerrygold Dubliner. Extensions of the Kerrygold label to new products such as spreadable blends and continental style cheeses have contributed to growth in Germany, where the brand is the market leader. One of the year’s most exciting launches was into a completely new category with Kerrygold Irish Cream Liqueur.</p>
<p>Supporting these product developments has required substantial capital expenditure in upgrading the Group’s facilities around the world. The latest and most exciting of these investments has been the decision to build a Centre of Excellence for Kerrygold butter production and packing in Mitchelstown, Co. Cork. This new development will ensure a world-class supply chain to meet the evolving needs of Kerrygold customers and consumers around the world and will support the growth and development of the iconic Kerrygold brand.</p>
