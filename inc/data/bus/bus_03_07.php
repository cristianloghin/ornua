				<h2>DPI Specialty Foods</h2>
				<p>Despite a very competitive environment, DPI continued to grow sales in 2014, by both winning new customer contracts and driving sales for existing retail partners. The positive momentum in the US economy increased customer retail spending but the environment remains very price competitive. In 2014 Turnover was up 9.1%, with DPI clearly maintaining its place as the third largest US distributor of speciality foods to the retail sector.</p>
