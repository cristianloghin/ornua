<p>Growing the DTI business is an important means of developing profitable new routes to market for Irish dairy products. Key activities include dairy commodity trading, product grading and maturing for cheese, and the development and supply of innovative and functional food solutions from Ireland and through a range of subsidiaries in the UK, the US, Spain and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>In 2014 the business reported solid results with strong growth in volume with member purchases up 16% and Turnover up 14.5% to €752.8 million. Strong performances were delivered by DTI Republic of Ireland (DTI ROI) and US Food Ingredients. There were mixed performances in the UK where the cheese grating, processing and butter trading businesses performed well but the powder blending business did not meet expectations, however the outlook for 2015 is much more positive.</p>
<p>The highlight of the year was the acquisition of a cheese business in Spain and the establishment of IDB España. The acquisition was in-line with the Group’s growth plans to make a strategic investment in Southern Europe, a milk deficit region. IDB España provides expert cheese solutions for the pizza sector that complement the cheese solution technologies being developed in the Group’s other international businesses.</p>
<p>DTI is focussed on building a sustainable future through the investment in route to market acquisitions, in-market resources, innovation, lean manufacturing, volatility management and manufacturing capacity and capability. These strategic investments will ensure that the IDB is adding value and building volume outlets for the post quota increased dairy volumes.</p>
