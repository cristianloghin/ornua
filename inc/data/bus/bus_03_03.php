				<p>2014 marked another significant year for the business in the US market, achieving the highest increase in sales volume growth in 10 years, at 36% year-on-year, contributing to a 39% revenue growth.</p>
				<p>Kerrygold butter led the charge in 2014 delivering a 77% increase in sales volumes, making it the number four branded butter in the US. While Kerrygold cheeses now hold three of the top six positions in the cheddar category.</p>
				<p>This strong performance has, in part, been driven by a highly successful, fully integrated campaign, which has included traditional and digital media. The campaign, Delicious… Because Nature Said So, showcases the unique attributes of grass-fed dairy farming and explains why grass-fed milk delivers the very best tasting cheese and butter. A key highlight of the year was the development of a new TV advert filmed on a dairy farm in Co. Waterford.</p> 
				<p>In addition to the success of its marketing and advertising campaigns, the US Consumer Foods business also achieved growth through product innovation. Kerrygold Butter with Canola Oil was launched in the US, offering consumers increased convenience and superior quality in a rapidly growing category. The US team also introduced two new cheese brands to market, Londoner and Shannonbridge.</p>
				<p>2014 saw a deepening of relationships for the US team with key retail partners, leading to expanded distribution with major super stores. Strategic in-store promotions delivered strong sales results during key selling periods.</p>

				<p>2014 proved to be a challenging trading year in the UK as the market experienced fundamental changes in retail structures, dairy price inflation, record milk production volumes and consumer purchasing habits. Despite all these factors, sales volumes were only marginally down on the record level achieved in 2013 and a strategic review of costs significantly improved efficiency within the business.</p>
				<p>The major business project of 2014 was the completion of the long-term strategic cheese supply partnership with First Milk. The strategic partnership further strengthens Adams Foods’ position as one of the UK’s leading suppliers of Irish and British cheese to major retailers and foodservice customers in the UK.</p>
				<p>Pilgrims Choice remains the clear number two UK cheddar brand with a retail value of £68 million. However, the brand portfolio had a challenging 2014. Pilgrims Choice declined in volume by 18% due to loss of distribution with a major retailer, the impact of inflation and increased competition from new market entrants and private labels. With a number of new product innovations and a re-invigorated marketing strategy using both digital and traditional media, Pilgrims Choice is well positioned for a good year in 2015.</p>
				<p>Kerrygold butter volumes were down on 2013 with the overall branded packet butter market also declining due to retailer focus on private label with £1 price points. Kerrygold maintained its premium price point and benefited from a change in promotional strategy to shallower discounts and a successful on-pack partnership with the iconic Irish designer, Orla Kiely.</p>

				<p>IDB Deutschland continues to build on its record of success over the last 40 years with another year of sales and organisational growth. An investment programme of €14 million was concluded in 2014 with the opening of expanded storage, packing and new product development facilities in Neukirchen-Vluyn.</p>
				<p>Kerrygold continues to be the number one butter brand in Germany, in terms of value and volume. Beyond this, its sales performance was in-line with expectations with strong sales performances by Kerrygold Extra. Kerrygold Extra is the clear number two in the spreadable market and is continuing to grow market share. Cheese also performed very strongly with a near 100% increase in volumes.</p>
				<p>NPD continues to be at the heart of the IDB Deutschland business. In 2014, IDB launched Kerrygold Extra 400g, a new unsalted sweet cream butter and Kildery cheese which won gold at the Global Cheese Awards.</p>

				<h3>IDB China</h3>
				<p>2014 saw the establishment of IDB China and the opening of its offices in Shanghai and Shenzhen. IDB China sells to over 1,000 retail outlets across 50 cities in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. It imports into China and distributes to a range of direct and distributor customers, serving China’s major retailers. It markets the full range of Kerrygold cheeses and butters and now, Kerrygold Whole Milk. The launch of Kerrygold Whole Milk marks IDB China’s entry into the mass Chinese market. The business plans to build its in-market presence through product innovation, acquisition and strategic partnership.</p> 
				<h3>IDB Russia</h3>
				<p>Kerrygold enjoyed a strong start to the year with volumes of butter and cheese exceeding expectations. The business has built a strong distribution network to support its growing partnerships with all the major retailers in Moscow and St Petersburg and with regional retailers.</p>
				<p>As with many other businesses, trade sanctions imposed by Russia against the EU have impacted the business. However, the business is maintaining a reduced team in IDB Russia to continue relationships with key retailers so it can respond quickly once this important market reopens to EU dairy.</p>
				<h3>IDB Europe &amp; Latin America</h3>
				<p>Kerrygold Regato continues to dominate the Greek market with a 60% market share and number one category position. In 2014 Kerrygold expanded its market portfolio with the launch of Regato slices supported by a new TV advert.</p>
				<p>The Iberian team relaunched Kerrygold in the Canary Islands and Portugal and is working closely with IDB España to develop retail opportunities with the recently acquired Spanish cheese business.</p> 
				<p>The IDB has been developing its business in Trinidad for over 40 years. In 2014 it delivered double-digit growth.</p>
				<h3>IDB Middle East</h3>
				<p>IDB Middle East has established a significant presence in the region, with offices based in Dubai, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The business in the region grew by over one third in 2014 with the launch of Kerrygold and Beo in Iraq and Kerrygold milk and Pilgrims Choice cheese in the U.A.E.</p> 
				<p>In addition to organic growth, the business seeks to continue to further strengthen its position in the important dairy growth markets in the MENA region through acquisition and strategic partnership, building on the success of the 2013 Al Wazeen acquisition.</p> 
				<p>IDB Middle East also manages the ingredients sales portfolio for the region which grew by 75% year-on-year.</p> 
				<h3>IDB Africa</h3>
				<p>The Group’s expansion drive has also seen the business deepen its long-standing presence in Africa, expanding activity across the continent, reaching more markets than ever before, with a new headquarters based in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Africa, a core market for Kerrygold for many years, holds massive promise for the future as its population and incomes grow. IDB Africa’s six largest markets are D.R.C., Nigeria, Angola, Algeria, Malawi and South Africa.</p>
				<p>2014 was a challenging year for the African business with the spike in milk powder prices, the Ebola crisis and macro-economic factors in a number of markets. The strength of the business’ in-market positions gave it the insight and flexibility to manage this.</p>
				<p>IDB Africa also manages substantial ingredients sales in the region which grew by over one third year-on-year.</p>
