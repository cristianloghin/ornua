				<p>DTI ROI is responsible for the procurement of products from members (Irish dairy processors) and the sale of dairy ingredients to global food manufacturers and brand owners.</p>
				<p>2014 was a good year for DTI ROI against the backdrop of a challenging market. Strong purchase prices were paid to members throughout the year and DTI ROI volume purchases were up 16% year-on-year to a record high. These increased purchases strengthened DTI ROI’s ingredient position in developing markets as well as ensuring adequate supply to IDB’s growing branded business. Within DTI ROI, the key account and international business units performed particularly well and have ambitious targets for 2015.</p>
				<p>The opportunities offered by the end of EU milk quotas remains a crucial focus for DTI ROI and the business’ experience in 2014 has given confidence that strategic business objectives with members, subsidiaries and key customer accounts are being delivered on schedule. The DTI division is reaping the benefits of increased integration between the different business units. DTI ROI also increased its in-market presence throughout the year in its strategically important markets of Africa and MENA and now has a strong, in-market presence driving business gains. All business units now operate off a global Customer Relationship Management platform.</p>
				<p>DTI ROI will remain focused on cost efficiencies, value added growth and volatility management in 2015 complemented by its trading business which will remain at the forefront of managing volatility in the markets.</p>

				<h3>Dairy Ingredients (UK) Ltd</h3>
				<p>Dairy Ingredients (UK) Ltd (DIUK) is a butter trading business and a major supplier to the UK food manufacturing sector. DIUK achieved a steady performance during a year of very turbulent market conditions. Supply, which was constrained in the first half of the year, improved towards year-end, in line with milk output and product stock availability.</p>
				<p>In 2015 DIUK looks to enhance its position as a key route to market for Irish butter in the new post quota era and the resultant increase in output of Irish milk based ingredients.</p>

				<p>Adams Food Ingredients Limited (AFI) is a leading powder blending business based in Leek. AFI provides sourcing, blending, formulating and packing excellence to leading blue-chip food manufacturing companies in the UK and internationally.</p>
