<h2 class="TextSubHeading1">33. Share based payment</h2>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">The Group operates a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for a limited number of executives and senior management. The purpose of the LTIP is to align the interest of participants and members to support the growth of the Irish Dairy Board. The LTIP is a cash settled share-based payment scheme which provides for options to be granted to employees. Options are granted to employees based on the value of a Notional Company “Irish Dairy Board Long Term Incentive Plan” (IDBLTIP). The value of IDBLTIP is primarily derived from an adjusted Group EBIT calculation adjusted to reflect product prices returned to members and some other variables. Participation in the plan and the number of options to be granted is at the sole discretion of the Personnel and Remuneration Sub-Committee on the recommendation of the Chief Executive.</p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">The maximum number of options that may be granted to any employee in any year is such that the number of options granted by the notional share price does not exceed the employee’s annual salary. The scheme commenced on 1 January 2013 and terminates on 30 April 2022. Options granted vest after 3 years provided the employee remains in employment of the Group over the period and provided specified performance conditions are met. Options will only vest after 3 years if the annualised compound growth in the value of IDBLTIP as calculated in accordance with the rules of the scheme over the 3 previous years is at least equal to 5% plus the growth in the Consumer Price Index. Vested awards are settled by way of a cash payment (over the following 3 years) to employees based on the growth in the value of the notional shares over which each participant has been awarded options. The Group has recognised an expense of €1.3m (2013: €0.5m) within employee costs in relation to the LTIP.</p>
