<h2 class="TextSubHeading1">1. Statement of accounting policies</h2>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(a) Basis of preparation</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">The financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles under the historical cost convention and comply with financial reporting standards of the Financial Reporting Council, as promulgated by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(b) Trading policy</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">In general it is the Parent Society’s trading policy to provide a return to supplying members equivalent to net proceeds realised in each product group. Accordingly the Parent Society’s purchase prices are subject to regular revision to reflect average market realisations. Arising from this policy, provision is made in the accounts for any amounts due to or from members.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(c) Basis of consolidation</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">The Group financial statements include the accounts of the Parent Society and its subsidiary companies, all of which are made up to 27 December 2014. The results of subsidiary companies are consolidated from their effective date of acquisition. Goodwill which arose on acquisitions prior to 31 December 1997 has been written off against reserves on acquisition. Goodwill arising on acquisitions since that date is capitalised and amortised over its expected useful economic life.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(d) Foreign currencies</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at a contracted rate. The resulting monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the balance sheet rate or the contracted rate and the exchange differences are dealt with in the profit and loss account.</p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">The Group’s net investments in overseas subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates are translated at the rate ruling at the balance sheet date except for goodwill. Goodwill arising on the investment in foreign currency subsidiaries is included at historic cost to the Group. In certain cases the Group provides long term loans to overseas subsidiaries, and such loans form part of the Group’s net investment in those overseas subsidiaries. The profits and losses of overseas subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates are translated at average rates for the year. Exchange differences resulting from the retranslation of the net investment in overseas subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates at closing rates, together with the differences on the translation of the profit and loss accounts, are dealt with through reserves and reflected in the statement of total recognised gains and losses. Where net investments are matched in whole or in part by foreign currency borrowings, the exchange differences arising on the retranslation of such borrowings are also recorded as reserve movements and reflected in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.</p>

<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(e) Financial Instruments</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">The Parent Society uses financial instruments to hedge exposures to foreign exchange fluctuations in its normal course of business and in accordance with the Group’s risk management policies. The Group’s policy is to use forward contracts to manage its exposures to foreign exchange risk. Exposure is transactional in nature and relates to sales contracts. The gains/losses on such instruments are recognised at the same time as the gains/losses are realised on the underlying hedged transaction.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(f) Turnover</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Turnover represents the fair value of goods and services supplied to external customers exclusive of trade discounts and value added tax. Goods are deemed to have been delivered and related revenue recognised when the customer has access to the significant benefits inherent in the goods and exposure to the risks inherent in these benefits. It includes EU sales support which is taken into account when the related produce is sold and excludes inter-group sales. Services are deemed to have been delivered on the rendering of the related service.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(g) Private Storage Aid Income</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">The Parent Society places stock in an EU scheme called Private Storage Aid during certain months of the year. The income earned from the EU on this stock is accounted for as it is earned. The financing element of the income earned is included as interest receivable in the financial statements, all other elements of the income are included in turnover.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(h) Tangible Assets</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.</p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Depreciation is not provided on freehold land. Depreciation on other tangible fixed assets is provided on a straight line or reducing balance basis as appropriate, the principal annual rates being as follows:</p>

</table>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Provision is made for any impairment of tangible fixed assets.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(i) Goodwill</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Purchased goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business represents the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets when they were acquired. Any excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired over the fair value of the acquisition cost is negative goodwill.</p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 31 December 1997 was eliminated against reserves on acquisition and negative goodwill arising on such acquisitions was credited directly to reserves as a matter of accounting policy. On the disposal of a business, any goodwill so treated is included in determining the profit or loss on sale of the business.</p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions after 1 January 1998 is capitalised in the balance sheet and written off on a straight line basis over its useful economic life, subject to a maximum of 15 years.</p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is shown separately on the Balance Sheet. Goodwill arising on the investment in foreign currency subsidiaries is included at the historic cost to the Group.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(j) Impairment</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">The carrying amounts of the Group’s goodwill and tangible assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is an indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset, or the cash generating unit to which it relates, is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the profit and loss account.</p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">The recoverable amount of such assets or cash generating units is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell or value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(k) Financial assets</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Financial fixed assets are shown at cost less provisions for permanent impairment.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(l) Redeemable loan stock</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Redeemable loan stock is included in equity until redemption. On redemption the amount redeemed is moved from equity to liabilities.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(m) Stocks</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises invoiced price from suppliers and inward freight costs. Net realisable value is based on contracted or estimated selling prices adjusted for EU sales support, less selling and distribution expenses.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(n) Debtors</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Debtors are included in the balance sheet based on outstanding amounts receivable at the period end from debtors less any provisions for doubtful debts.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(o) Taxation</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Current taxation represents the amount expected to be paid or recovered in respect of taxable profit for the period and is calculated using the taxation rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.</p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.</p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Timing differences are differences between profit as computed for taxation purposes and profit as stated in the financial statements which arise because certain items of income and expenditure in the financial statements are dealt with in different periods for taxation purposes.</p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted. Deferred taxation is measured on a discounted basis at the taxation rates that are anticipated to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse, based on taxation rates and legislation which are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(p) Grants</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Capital based grants are accounted for in the period they are received and are treated as deferred credits. These grants are released to the profit and loss account on the same basis as the related assets are depreciated.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(q) Research and development</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Research and development expenditure is written off to the profit and loss account in the period in which it is incurred.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(r) Leased assets</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(s) Post retirement benefits</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">The Group operates a number of externally and internally funded pension schemes for its Irish employees and some employees overseas. The assets of the externally funded pension plans are managed by third-party investment managers and are held separately in trust. Regular valuations are prepared by independent professionally qualified actuaries. These determine the level of contributions required to fund the benefits set out in the rules of the plans and allow for the periodic increase of pension payments. The regular service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees during the period, together with the cost of any benefits relating to past service is charged to operating surplus in the period.</p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">A credit representing the expected return on the assets of the retirement benefit schemes during the period is included within other finance income. This is based on the market value of the assets of the schemes at the start of the financial period adjusted for movements during the period.</p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">A charge within other finance costs representing the interest cost on the liabilities of the retirement benefit schemes during the period is netted against other finance income. This arises from the liabilities of the schemes being one year closer to payment.</p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">The difference between the bid value of assets and the present value of accrued pension liabilities is shown as an asset or liability in the balance sheet net of deferred tax.</p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Differences between actual and expected returns on assets during the period are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses in the period, together with differences arising from changes in assumptions and experience (gains)/losses on the schemes’ liabilities.</p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which the related services are received from the relevant employees.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(t) Assets held for sale</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">A tangible fixed asset is classified as held for sale when its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction. Tangible fixed assets held for sale are carried at the lower of their carrying amount, or fair value less costs to sell.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(u) Discontinued operations</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area that has been disposed of. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal. When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative Group profit and loss account is represented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative period.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(v) Provisions</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">A provision is recognised when the Group has a present (either legal or constructive) obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount required to settle the obligation. A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a restructuring plan and the restructuring has commenced. Insurance provisions are recognised to cover claims including claims which are known to be incurred but not reported at period end.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(w) Share based payment</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">The Group operates a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The LTIP is a cash settled share-based payment scheme which provides for options to be granted to a limited number of executives and senior management. Options are granted based on the value of a Notional Company “Irish Dairy Board Long Term Incentive Plan” (IDBLTIP). The value of IDBLTIP is primarily derived from an adjusted Group EBIT calculation adjusted to reflect product prices returned to members and some other variables. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted at the grant date. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number and value of options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the profit &amp; loss account, and a corresponding adjustment to liabilities.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(x) Estimation techniques</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">The following accounting policies utilise estimation techniques: tangible assets, goodwill, impairment and post retirement benefits.</p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">(y) Cash and liquid resources</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Cash, for the purpose of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts payable on demand. Liquid resources are current asset investments which are disposable without curtailing or disrupting the business and are either readily convertible into known amounts of cash at or close to their carrying values or traded in an active market. Liquid resources comprise term deposits of less than one year.</p>
