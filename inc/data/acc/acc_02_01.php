</p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">We have audited the group financial statements of Irish Dairy Board Co-operative Limited for the period ended 27 December 2014 which comprise the Group Profit and Loss Account, the Group Balance Sheet, the Group Cash Flow Statement, the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is Irish law and accounting standards issued by the Financial Reporting Council and promulgated by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland (Generally Accepted Accounting Practice in Ireland). </p>
<h2 class="TextSubHeading1">Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors</h2>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 34, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the group financial statements giving a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the group financial statements in accordance with Irish law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.</p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the society’s members as a body in accordance with Section 13 of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.</p>
<h2 class="TextSubHeading1">Scope of the audit of the financial statements</h2>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited group financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.</p>
<h2 class="TextSubHeading1">Opinion on group financial statements </h2>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">In our opinion the group financial statements: </p>
<ul>
<li class="TextBodyCopyBulletList">give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 27 December 2014 and of its surplus and cash flows for the period then ended; and</li>
<li class="TextBodyCopyBulletList">have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Practice in Ireland.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="TextSubHeading1">Matter on which we are required to report by the Industrial and Provident Societies Act</h2>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">As required by Section 13(2) of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893 we examined the parent society balance sheet showing the receipts and expenditure, funds and effects of the society, and verified the same with the books, deeds, documents, accounts and vouchers relating thereto, and found them to be correct, duly vouched, and in accordance with law.</p>
