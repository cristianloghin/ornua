<h1 class="LargeHeading">Sustainability</h1>
<p class="TextIntroCopy">2015 will be the beginning of a new era for Irish dairy. At the heart of this new era will be old traditions. Irish dairy farmers have been farming in harmony with nature for thousands of years. Our lush green landscape and temperate climate provide the ideal conditions for sustainable dairy farming and offer Irish produce a unique selling point in international markets. As an industry we are moving in tandem to prove and improve our sustainability credentials. Sustainability is at the heart of the IDB. It is embedded in everything we do and while we are proud of our current position as a world leader in sustainable dairy we look forward to working with the industry to continuously improve every aspect of our business. </p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">For generations Irish family farms have been practicing sustainable farming methods. Our grass-based production system is amongst the most sustainable in the world. To preserve the extraordinary value of the industry, IDB strives to continuously maintain a sharp focus on the quality of the dairy products it produces. Maintaining the integrity of the industry and its reputation for excellence in food safety and quality is fundamental to growing the business. This is why IDB so strongly supports Bord Biaâ€™s Sustainable Dairy Assurance Scheme.</p>
