<h2 class="TextSubHeading1">Sustainable Farming </h2>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">2014 was the International Year of Family Farming. The family is at the heart of Irish dairy farming. The passion for farming is passed down from generation to generation and has shaped the way we farm. It is not uncommon for three generations of an Irish family to work together on the same farm. Land is also passed down through the family; in fact the average Irish farm only changes hands outside the family once every 550 years.</p>
<h2 class="TextSubHeading1">Sustainable Dairy Assurance Scheme (SDAS)</h2>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Todayâ€™s consumer demands high-quality, sustainably produced products. Our customers are moving quickly to react to this consumer demand. They have put stringent programmes in place to ensure sustainable production throughout their entire supply chain. While for many of our competitors the sustainability demands of these customers will present a challenge, for the Irish dairy industry, it presents an opportunity to showcase what we do naturally. Ireland has the perfect attributes for sustainable dairy farming, and with the SDAS we can now prove it. The SDAS audits dairy farmers against over 170 criteria at 18 month intervals. The scheme measures performance in quality and sustainability and determines the carbon footprint of every Irish dairy farm. In this new post quota environment, SDAS, will be a vital tool in proving our sustainability attributes and will enable the IDB, on behalf of the industry, to market and promote the premium attributes of Irish dairy products. </p>
<h2 class="TextSubHeading1">Sustainable Operations </h2>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">Origin Green</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Origin Green is an industry sustainability programme which requires participants to develop and implement sustainability plans in areas such as procurement, operations and social sustainability. In 2013 IDB became the first dairy company to receive Origin Green Accreditation. We are proud to have maintained our accreditation in 2014. In 2014 we also provided support to a number of our members as they sought accreditation. 98% of our Irish product comes from companies engaging in Origin Green. In 2015 we hope to achieve 100% procurement from Origin Green participants in Ireland. </p>
<h3 class="TextSubHeading2">Sustainability Continuous Improvement Programme</h3>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">To further complement Origin Green, IDB has developed a Sustainability Continuous Improvement Programme at all of our global sites. The programme involves measuring and managing energy, water and waste consumption <span>against key performance indicators at each site</span>. We are proud to have implemented a number of best practice initiatives at our sites and achieved significant results including: </p>
<ul>
	<li class="TextBodyCopyBulletList">16% reduction in electricity consumption at Head Office since 2012</li>
	<li class="TextBodyCopyBulletList">18% reduction in thermal energy at Adams Foods Limited in 2014</li>
	<li class="TextBodyCopyBulletList">Installation of an RO system (Reverse Osmosis) at Thiel facility in Wisconsin which will save around 4.5 million litres of water a year</li>
	<li class="TextBodyCopyBulletList">10% reduction of waste at IDB Deutschland</li>
</ul>	
<p class="TextBodyCopy">In 2014 IDB also incorporated sustainability into the design process for all new construction developments.</p>
<h2 class="TextSubHeading1">Quality</h2>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">In 2014 the IDB introduced a Global Supply Chain Integrity project to continuously improve how it works with third party stakeholders worldwide, to drive increased quality and food safety standards. In the first year of the project over 30 sites were visited and audited across the world. The IDB also maintained BRC Grade A rating across all Group subsidiary factories including achieving accreditation within three months of the opening of the new Thiel facility in Hilbert, Wisconsin. </p>
<h2 class="TextSubHeading1">Logistics</h2>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">During 2014 the business worked closely with all transport and logistics partners in preparation for the introduction of Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECA) and to ensure full compliance for 2015. It continues to include sustainability in the tender process for all transport, logistic and supply chain contracts and partners with service providers to ensure a minimal impact on the environment. </p>
