<p class="TextIntroCopy">The Irish Dairy Board Co-operative Limited (IDB or “the Society”) is committed to operating in accordance with best practice in corporate governance. This means maintaining the highest standards of financial reporting, business integrity and ethics. </p>
<h2 class="TextSubHeading1">Governance in Action</h2>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">The IDB Board (“the Board”) consists entirely of non-executive Directors, appointed or elected in accordance with the Rules of the Irish Dairy Board Co-operative Ltd. The non-executive Directors (Board members) represent supplier members to the Society and farming organisations. </p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">The Board’s principal responsibilities are to agree overall strategy and investment policy, approve major capital expenditure, provide an essential challenge function to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and other Executives, monitor Executive performance and ensure that good corporate governance is observed at all times, including the presence of proper internal controls and risk management practices. </p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">As well as ensuring compliance with its principal legislative duties, as set out under the Companies Act 1963-2013 and the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts 1893-1978, the Board has a number of matters reserved for its consideration.</p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">It plays a key role in scrutinising financial and business performance. The Group’s planning and financial reporting procedures include detailed operational budgets for the year ahead, the delivery of KPIs and a regularly updated five year plan, all of which require Board review and approval. </p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">The Board receives regular reports on important operational and business issues arising in the three Group divisions. It also receives topical briefs during the year to help individual Directors remain fully informed and responsive to relevant developments. </p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">The Board held 10 ordinary meetings in 2014 which covered routine Board business. Separate strategically themed workshop meetings were also held. </p>
<p class="TextBodyCopy">Measures like these ensure that all Board Directors are aware of, and are in a position to, monitor business progress and to discharge effectively their individual Directors’ duties under the governing legislation. </p>
